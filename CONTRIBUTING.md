## Before Pushing Code

**Always run these checks before pushing:**

```bash
# 1. Type check
npm run type-check

# 2. Lint
npm run lint

# 3. Build (catches runtime errors)
npm run build
```

All three must pass before pushing to main.

## Quick Check Script

```bash
npm run check
```

This runs all checks in sequence.
